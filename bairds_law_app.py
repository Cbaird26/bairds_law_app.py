st.write("""
### 1. General Relativity (GR)
General Relativity, developed by Albert Einstein, describes gravity not as a force but as a curvature of spacetime caused by mass and energy. Objects follow the geodesics in this curved spacetime, which appears to us as gravitational attraction. This theory is mathematically represented by the Einstein field equations, which relate the geometry of spacetime (expressed through the Ricci curvature tensor \( R \) and the metric tensor \( g \)) to the energy and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present. 

In Baird's Law, General Relativity provides the foundation for understanding how mass and energy interact with spacetime. The Ricci scalar \( R \) and the determinant of the metric tensor \( \sqrt{-g} \) are crucial components of the unified action:

\[
S_{\text{ToE}} = \int d^{11}x \sqrt{-g} \left( R + \mathcal{L}_{\text{SM}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{string}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{quantum}} + \mathcal{L}_{\text{LQG}} \right)
\]

st.write("""
### 2. Standard Model of Particle Physics (SM)
The Standard Model of Particle Physics is a well-established theory that describes the electromagnetic, weak, and strong nuclear interactions, which are the forces that govern the behavior of all known subatomic particles. It incorporates a variety of particles, including quarks, leptons, gauge bosons, and the Higgs boson, and it explains how these particles interact through force carriers.

The Lagrangian density for the Standard Model \( \mathcal{L}_{\text{SM}} \) includes terms for:
- Gauge fields (\( F_{\mu\nu} \)): Represent the force carriers (like photons, W and Z bosons, gluons).
- Fermions (\( \psi \)): Represent matter particles like electrons and quarks.
- The Higgs mechanism (\( \phi \)): Provides mass to the gauge bosons through spontaneous symmetry breaking.

In the unified framework, the Standard Model is essential for describing particle interactions and the fundamental forces, contributing to the overall Lagrangian density:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{SM}} = -\frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} + \bar{\psi}(i\gamma^\mu D_\mu - m)\psi + \left| D_\mu \phi \right|^2 - V(\phi)
\]

st.write("""
### 3. String Theory
String Theory posits that the fundamental constituents of the universe are not point-like particles but one-dimensional "strings" that can vibrate at different frequencies. These vibrations determine the properties of particles, such as their mass and charge. String Theory aims to reconcile quantum mechanics and general relativity, providing a framework where all forces and particles can be unified.

In the context of Baird's Law, String Theory contributes to the Lagrangian density \( \mathcal{L}_{\text{string}} \):

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{string}} = \frac{1}{2\pi\alpha'} \int d^2\sigma \sqrt{-h} h^{ab} \partial_a X^\mu \partial_b X_\mu
\]

Here, \( \alpha' \) is the string tension, \( h \) is the induced metric on the string worldsheet, and \( X^\mu \) are the string coordinates.

String Theory is crucial for providing a consistent quantum theory of gravity and unifying the different fundamental forces within a single framework.

st.write("""
### 4. Quantum Mechanics and Quantum Field Theory (QFT)
Quantum Mechanics provides the foundation for understanding the behavior of particles at the smallest scales, where the effects of quantum uncertainty and wave-particle duality become significant. Quantum Field Theory extends quantum mechanics to fields, describing how particles are excitations of underlying fields.

QFT is essential for describing particle interactions and fields in a manner consistent with both quantum mechanics and special relativity. The Lagrangian density for QFT \( \mathcal{L}_{\text{quantum}} \) includes terms for:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{quantum}} = \bar{\psi}(i\gamma^\mu \partial_\mu - m)\psi - \frac{1}{4} F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}
\]

Where \( \bar{\psi} \) represents the fermion fields, \( \gamma^\mu \) are the gamma matrices, \( F_{\mu\nu} \) is the field strength tensor, and \( m \) is the mass.

In Baird's Law, QFT ensures that the description of particles and their interactions is consistent with quantum mechanics.

st.write("""
### 5. Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG)
Loop Quantum Gravity is an approach to quantize spacetime itself, treating it as a network of discrete loops. This theory aims to reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics without requiring a background spacetime, suggesting that spacetime is fundamentally discrete at the Planck scale.

The Lagrangian density for Loop Quantum Gravity \( \mathcal{L}_{\text{LQG}} \) includes terms that describe the quantum properties of spacetime:

\[
\mathcal{L}_{\text{LQG}} = \frac{1}{16\pi G} \left( \epsilon^{abcde} e_a^I e_b^J F_{cdIJ} \right)
\]

Where \( \epsilon^{abcde} \) is the Levi-Civita symbol, \( e_a^I \) are the tetrad fields, and \( F_{cdIJ} \) is the field strength tensor.

LQG provides a way to understand the quantum nature of gravity and spacetime, contributing to the unified framework in Baird's Law.
